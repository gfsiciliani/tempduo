# tempduo

## Synopsis of project
I started this project with the end goal of crafting an intuitive learning approach to naturalize the world's two most commonly used temperature scales (fahrenheit and celsius). My motivation to explore this is twofold. One: I wish to learn celsius, and Two: I've always enjoyed weather.

## The problem of mental math

## Methods
While the conversion is relatively simple and can easily be done with mental math, I seek to create visualizations which instill a more intuitive relationship with the initial reading of the temperature.

## My hypothesis
visualizing the variance of the delta between a range of commonly encountered temperatures (-40f - 110f) will assist in this intuitive learning goal.

## A few thoughts
I imagine immersing one's self in the daily reading and experiencing of the unit one desires to learn would be optimum. Even if one were to translocate to a different country, this transition would be binary. My hope is that - beyond these initial explorations - my learnings inform how I may implement features in weather-centric apps that feature easy toggling or simultaneous viewing of fahrenheit and celsius. The common thread amongst these hopes and explorations is my insistence that we should not have to spend time converting between the two units in the scenario of just trying to figure out how we should dress for the day.
